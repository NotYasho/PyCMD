## FAQs:

- Why did you name it **Py**CMD? 
>  Â¯\\_\(ãƒ„\)\_\/Â¯, but I think it's an **ok** name. Also `Py` represents the Python language in which PYCMD was written. Not the best name, but okay. 

- How do you use PyCMD?
> You can use the `pycmd` command. It will help you to get started.

- Why should I use PyCMD?
> PyCMD saves you a lot of time, you can use it to manage your projects if they are messy or if you want to make a lot of changes in short time. Not only that but also it will help you to make your projects more readable and maintainable.

- What are the Pros and Cons of PyCMD?

> | Pros | Cons |
> | ---- | ---- |
> | Easy to use | Might be an overkill |
> | Saves Time | Compaitable with Windows only |
> | Generates Boiler Plate | |
> | Manages GIT | |
> | Light - Doesn't take too much space |


- Does PyCMD collect any user data?
> No, PyCMD doesn't collect any user data. It stores the configuration in a file `config.json`.

- How do you contribute to PyCMD?
> You can contribute to PyCMD by [opening an issue](https://www.github.com/Yasho022/PyCMD/issues) or [forking](https://www.github.com/Yasho022/PyCMD/fork). 

- But seriously, I don't like the name?
> You can change the name of `PyCMD` to something else by renaming the `pycmd.cmd` in the `bin` folder.
> Example:
> ```
> ren bin/pycmd.cmd nevergonnagiveyouup.cmd
> ```
> However, this will only change the name to use PYCMD, all the commands will still use the `PyCMD` name.
